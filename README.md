🔍 Key Findings
EMS calls are the most frequent, followed by Traffic and Fire.
Mondays and daytime hours (9AM–4PM) are the peak periods for calls.
Random Forest model provided the best classification performance.
Power BI dashboard enables interactive analysis of emergency trends.
📈 Power BI Dashboard
Filters by Date, Township, and Emergency Reason
Visual insights include heatmaps, trend lines, and KPI cards
Helps users explore call volume, time trends, and geographic patterns
🧪 Statistical Insights
